HeapSort
========

This is an implementation of HeapSort. There's nothing special about it. I use it only to check out GitHub features.

How to build and execute
------------------------

To build and execute that program you'll need Mono or .NET.
Than you can build by executing:

```
xbuild /p:Configuration=Release HeapSort.csproj
```

Now you can run it by executing:

```
mono bin/Release/HeapSort.exe
```
